        "## What is RAG?\n",
        "RAG is a machine learning concept that aims to enhance the capabilities of generative AI models with external knowledge sourced from a document collection. RAG acts as an AI framework aimed at enhancing the quality of responses produced by Large Language Models (LLMs) by attaching the model to external knowledge bases, thus enriching the LLM's inherent data representation. Incorporating RAG in a question answering system powered by an LLM (e.g., GPT, LLaMA2, Falcon, etc.) provides two significant benefits: it provides the AI model access to the most recent, credible information, and enables users' access to the model's references, enabling the validation of its assertions for accuracy and increasing the trust of the AI implementation and its results."

Example code URL url = new URL(\"http://www.google.com\"); HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream(); See also: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) Use of insecure network protocols The problem: Loading data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to replace, remove, and inject code. Auditing tips ● Review the app’s network security configuration (an Android P feature) to understand whether app is allowed to use insecure network protocols in the first place. ○ https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config (“Network security configuration”) ● Grep the app’s code for “http:”, “ftp”, “smtp:”, and URLs that indicate use of insecure network protocols. ● Understand common entry points into the network such as the URL class or the WebView class and check whether there are code flows that lead to insecure connections being made. Use of insecure network protocols The problem: Loading data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to replace, remove, and inject code. Remediation ● Apps targeting Android P and above are safe by default. If such apps still want to make insecure connections, they have to define a network security configuration that allows that. ● Use javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection as much as possible. ● Presubmit checks to look for URLs for insecure protocols are easy to set up. ● The Android Lint check InsecureBaseConfiguration flags insecure HTTP connections. Data transmission over insecure protocols The problem: Sending sensitive data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Example code URL url = new URL(\"http://www.mysite.com?lookupNumber=\" + phoneNumber); HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream(); See also: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) Data transmission over insecure protocols The problem: Sending sensitive data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the'}, {'id': 'chunk-1', 'content': 'network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Auditing tips ● In addition to the auditing tips for finding the use of insecure network protocols: ○ Understand which user data and application data is potentially sensitive ○ Audit whether any network connections over insecure protocols send potentially sensitive data to network endpoints Data transmission over insecure protocols The problem: Sending sensitive data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Remediation ● Exactly the same as for the use of insecure network connections Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Example code URL url = new URL(\"http://www.mysite.com?user=bugdroid&pwd=androidnumber one\"); HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream(); See also: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Auditing tips ● In addition to the auditing tips for finding the use of insecure network protocols: ○ Understand which login information the app is working with ○ Audit whether any network connections over insecure protocols send login information to network endpoints Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Remediation ● In general the same as for the use of insecure network connections. ● Authentication should probably be handled through a common, security-vetted method such as OAuth. Custom authentication schemes are likely to get more wrong than just insecure network protocols. Cryptography and authentication Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Example code ParseTwitterUtils.initialize( \"CONSUMER KEY\", \"CONSUMER SECRET\"); flag{a0a6cb3b4bc98bf2a34b7aed76aebf53} See also: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Auditing tips ● Compile a list of interesting public APIs and create regular expressions to find keys or secrets through grep. ● Compile a list of interesting public APIs and look for their package names in apps. ● Grep for “key”, “password”, “login”, “secret” and such. Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Remediation ● Follow best practices for the used API as documented in their help center. ○ Some APIs encourage you to embed their secrets in the app as a secret compromise will have limited negative effects. ● Some third-party services offer more secure alternatives to embedding credentials in the app (such as Amazon and Google) while others'}, {'id': 'chunk-2', 'content': 'like Twitter consider embedding the third-party secrets in the code as best practice. ○ For services which don’t provide a per-user authentication service, it’s possible to spin up your own server that handles this. ● For services that recommend embedding third-party secrets in the app, expect the secrets to be extracted and abused by attackers. The goal for such situations is to mitigate the negative effects of the abuse. Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Example code private static String SECRET_KEY = \"MySecretAESKey99\"; private static byte[] encrypt(String inputText) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(SECRET_KEY.getBytes(), \"AES\")); return cipher.doFinal(inputText.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")); } See also: CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Auditing tips ● Look for all uses of APIs in the javax.crypto package ● Look for all embedded popular cryptography libraries ● Audit initialization and use of discovered cryptography APIs Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Remediation ● Understand what you are trying to protect from whom ○ In many cases using embedded secrets is actually fine ● Avoid rolling your own crypto by abstracting what you’re trying to do and using a ready-made library for your purpose Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Example code String url = \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\"; url += \"?client_id=XXXX\"; url += \"&redirect_url=com%2Emy%2Eapp%3A%2F%2Foauth\"; url += \"&response_type=token\"; // Use Implicit Grant =( url += \"&scope=email\"; Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url)); startActivity(i); See also: CWE-??? (???) Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Auditing tips ● Search for OAuth endpoint URLs being sent to the browser and check what parameters are being passed ○ Implicit grant is always bad ○ If using Authz flow, check for PKCE use ○ If using PKCE, check that it is not predictable Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Remediation ● Use a platform-integrated authentication flow rather than the browser. ○ Much more foolproof. ● If using OAuth in the browser, use the Authz flow with PKCE ○ Make sure you aren’t using a hardcoded secret or nonce Private file access Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Example code public class FileUploader extends Activity { protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { String path = getIntent().getExtras().getString(“path”); String url = getIntent().getExtras().getString(“url”); uploadFile(path, url); } } See also: CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Information (\\'Privacy Violation\\')) Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Auditing tips ● Look for files stored on external storage which is world-readable by default. ● Look for files stored in internal storage whose access attributes are changed to make them world-accessible.'}, {'id': 'chunk-3', 'content': '● Look for unsanitized file or path names that are supplied by potential attackers. Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Remediation ● Store files in internal storage with default access attribute unless you want to intentionally share them with other apps. ● Limit the ability of users to supply their own path or file names. ● Verify that the canonical path of a file or path points to an expected path. ○ Watch out for TOCTOU issues. Symlinks can change at any time. Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Example code OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(PUBLIC_DIRECTORY + \"/Download/\" + filename); See also: CWE Category 21 (Pathname Traversal and Equivalence Errors) Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Auditing tips ● Find any kind of path or file operations with variable input and see if they rely on user-provided input. Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Remediation ● Limit the ability of users to supply their own path or file names. ● Verify that the canonical path of a file or path points to an expected path right before doing file operations on the file or path. Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Example code InputStream is = new FileInputStream(zipFilePath); ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(is)); ZipEntry ze; while ((ze = zis.getNextEntry()) != null) { outputFileName = ze.getName(); writeToFile(outputFileName, zis); } See also: CWE ??? (???) Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Auditing tips ● Find all uses of APIs in the java.util.zip.* package or third-party zipping libraries. ● Understand whether user-provided ZIP files are being unzipped by the code. Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Remediation ● Validate that the canonical path of unzipped files points to the real directory to unzip to. ○ A Google search for “android zip path traversal” will lead to examples. Unprotected app parts Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Example code <activity android:name=\"com.mypackage.SomeActivity\"> ... <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"com.mypackage.OPEN\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /> </intent-filter> ... </activity> See also: CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by'}, {'id': 'chunk-4', 'content': 'other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Auditing tips ● Understand what conditions can lead to activities being exported ○ android:exported attribute ○ Presence of intent filters auto-exports activities ● Go through list of activities declared in manifest XML file ○ Find those that are exported Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Remediation ● Explicitly mark components with android:exported=\"false\" in the application manifest ● Use android:protectionLevel=\"signature\" in the xml manifest to restrict access to applications signed by you Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Example code <service android:name=\"com.myapp.service\"> ... <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"com.myapp.START_SERVICE\" /> </intent-filter> ... </service> See also: CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Auditing tips ● Same as for unprotected activities Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Remediation ● Same as for unprotected activities Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Example code <permission android:label=\"@string/write_contact_permission\" android:name=\"my.app.permission.write\" /> <provider android:label=\"@string/contacts\" android:name=\"my.app.ContactsProvider\" android:writePermission=\"my.app.permissions.write\"/> See also: CWE-??? (???) Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Auditing tips ● For stand-alone applications, check that declared and used permissions match in the manifest file. ○ For sets of apps, check that declared and used permissions match across the whole set of apps. Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Remediation ● If you are using custom permissions you can set up a presubmit check to see whether any declared permissions are not used or any used permissions are undeclared. ○ Doesn’t quite work if you have multiple interacting apps where not all apps declare and use the same permissions. Maybe a whitelist in the presubmit check is possible. Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Example code protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) { if (intent != null) { Intent privateIntent = new Intent(this, parseIntentClass(intent)); startActivity(privateIntent); } } See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Auditing tips ● Find calls to startActivity and verify that Intent components are constructed from trusted data. ● Find calls Intent::getExtras where returned values are cast to Intent and verify that they are properly checked before being used. ○ It isn’t enough to check the target class name. Malware can reuse your class names and force your app to send an Intent'}, {'id': 'chunk-5', 'content': 'that grants content:// URI access to their app. Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Remediation ● Whenever sending an Intent created from untrusted data ○ Check the class name and package name of the target component or… ○ Check the signing key of the app that owns the target component ○ Verify that Intents don’t contain FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION or FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Example code android.content.Intent intent = new android.content.Intent(); intent.putExtra(\"SMS\", smsMessage); intent.setAction(\"my.app.sms\"); intent.setClass(context, my.app.SmsHandler); sendBroadcast(intent); See also: CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Auditing tips ● Look for all intent broadcasts that do not have a target set ○ Called implicit broadcasts ○ Lacks setComponent, setClass, setClassName or an explicit constructor Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Remediation ● Turn as many implicit intents into explicit intents. ● For the intents that cannot be made explicit understand that they can be intercepted ○ Think through the worst case scenarios. ○ Document why these intents are implicit. Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Example code final class Receiver extends BroadcastReceiver { public final void onReceive(Context ctx, Intent intent) { if (verifyPackageName(getCallingActivity())) { doSomethingSecret(); } } } Don’t actually know what verifyPackageName would look like. See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Auditing tips ● Find all receivers in the app ○ Look at manifest file and for Context.registerReceiver calls. ○ Non-exported receivers are safe as they can only receive broadcasts from inside the app. Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Remediation ● Make as many receivers as possible non-exported. ● For receivers that have to stay exported, treat all inputs as untrusted. Other Everything else that doesn’t fit anywhere Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to get URL parsing and verification wrong. Example code // Just one of many ways to get URL verification wrong if (uri.getHost().endsWith(\"mywebsite.com\")) { webView.loadUrl(uri.toString()); } See also: CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme) Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to'}, {'id': 'chunk-6', 'content': 'get URL parsing and verification wrong. Auditing tips ● Find every instance of URLs being used in an app ● Narrow it down to those that work on user-controlled input ● Narrow it down to those that are used to branch between different code paths ○ Could be any part of the URL, not just the host name Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to get URL parsing and verification wrong. Remediation ● Read and understand https://hackerone.com/reports/431002 ○ “Golden techniques to bypass host validations in Android apps” ● Create a library that follows best practices and always use that when trying to verify URLs Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Example code Intent intent = getIntent(); String url = intent.getStringExtra(“url”); WebView myWebview = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.foo); // url points to the cookies database, is a javascript: // url, or is a phishing url myWebview.loadUrl(url); See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Auditing tips ● Find calls to loadUrl and evaluateJavascript in your app. ● Verify that inputs to these functions are trusted or sanitized (or both). ● Check for dangerous WebView settings like setAllowFileAccess(true) ○ Files can contain *both* malicious scripts and sensitive user data (the cookies database). Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Remediation ● Disable WebView file access unless it is needed. ○ Use setAllowFileAccess(false) ● Target up-to-date SDK versions to prevent javascript: URLs ● Make sure that app-private Activities aren’t exported by accident ○ Creating an intent-filter exports the component by default! ● Verify that URLs from external sources are safe to load before calling loadUrl() ○ URL validation can be tricky as you just learned. ○ Think carefully about what URLs are acceptable. Same-origin-policy does not protect against phishing. Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Example code PythonInterpreter interpreter = new PythonInterpreter(); interpreter.exec( \"from shutil import copyfile\\\\n copyfile(\\\\\"passwords.bin\\\\\", \\\\\"/sdcard/passwords.bin\\\\\" ); See also: CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Auditing tips ● Look for indicators of scripting languages ○ Common interpreters such as Python inside the app. ○ Interpreters may be hidden in file formats like PDF (Javascript). ○ Look for Android and Java sandboxing libraries. ● Check whether these interpreters allow untrusted input. Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding'}, {'id': 'chunk-7', 'content': 'a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Remediation ● Disable user-supplied input if possible. ● Build your own limited-scope interpreter or interface to more permissive interpreters. ● Otherwise sanitize scripts, disable scripting, or restrict permissions and abilities of interpreter engine. Unprotected data on server The problem: An app connects to a remote web server, database, or API that does not sufficiently protect sensitive user data. Any attacker can access this data. Example code Not applicable since the problem is not in the application code. See also: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) Unprotected data on server The problem: An app connects to a remote web server, database, or API that does not sufficiently protect sensitive user data. Any attacker can access this data. Auditing tips ● Find all instances of an app connecting out to a remote server, either in the main app or through SDKs. ● Understand default and custom configuration options for remote endpoints. Bug Bounty through the Google Play Security Reward Program: $0 (not in scope) Unprotected data on server The problem: An app connects to a remote web server, database, or API that does not sufficiently protect sensitive user data. Any attacker can access this data. Remediation 1Vulnerability Detection on Android Apps–Inspired by Case Study on Vulnerability Related with Web Functions INDEX TERMS algorithms more and more rapid. In this circumstance, developers focus on how to quickly implement the logical functions of Apps and make it more user-friendly. Nevertheless, they spend little time on security issues of Apps.Static analysis, Vulnerability, Mobile agents, Security, Application software, DetectionABSTRACT Nowadays, people’s lifestyle is more and more dependent on mobile applications (Apps), such as shopping, ﬁnancial management and surﬁng the internet. However, developers mainly focus on the implementation of Apps and the improvement of user experience while ignoring security issues. In this paper, we perform the comprehensive study on vulnerabilities caused by misuse of APIs and form a methodology for this type of vulnerability analysis. We investigate the security of three types of Android Apps including ﬁnance, shopping and browser which are closely related to human life. And we analyze four vulnerabilities including Improper certiﬁcate validation(CWE-295:ICV), WebView bypass certiﬁcate vali- dation vulnerability(CVE-2014-5531:WBCVV), WebView remote code execution vulnerability(CVE-2014- 1939:WRCEV) and Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability(CNVD-2017-09774:ACOCDV). In order to verify the effectiveness of our analysis method in large-scale Apps on the Internet, we propose a novel scalable tool - VulArcher, which is based on heuristic method and used to discover if the above vulnerabilities exist in Apps. We download a total of 6114 of the above three types of samples in App stores, and we use VulArcher to perform the above vulnerability detection for each App. We perform manual veriﬁcation by randomly selecting 100 samples of each vulnerability. We ﬁnd that the accuracy rate for ACOCDV can reach 100%, the accuracy rate for WBCVV can reach 95%, and the accuracy rate for the other two vulnerabilities can reach 87%. And one of vulnerabilities detected by VulArcher has been included in China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) ID(CNVD-2017-23282). Experiments show'}, {'id': 'chunk-8', 'content': 'that our tool is feasible and effective. For the convenience of researchers in related communities, We make our data and tool available at https://buptnsrclab.github.io/blog/2020/01/03/vularcher-site-launched. et al. [13] analyzed a large-scale of mobile web Apps, and found that vulnerabilities are presented in all corners of the Android ecosystem. They did not propose methods for vulnerability veriﬁcation. Li et al. [14] analysed a small set of Android music Apps and focused on the issue of data leakage during client and server communication. Li et al. [15] [16] proposed a solution to quickly identify Android source code vulnerability ignoring to analyse Apps’ vulnerabilities. Mu et al. [17] contributed to how to quickly reproduce the vulnerabilities by combining the vulnerability reports with widely crowdsourced information. In 2019, Diao et al. [8] analyzed one vulnerability caused by the usage of theI. INTRODUCTION2accessibility API. Amin et al. [9] focused on proposing a detection tool for Android vulnerabilities, they did not give out a methodology for analyzing Android vulnerabilities. Luo et al. [18] was concerned about the vulnerabilities of the Android Framework and adopt a symbolic execution method to detect vulnerabilities. Wu et al. [19] conducted a systematic study for Android system vulnerabilities. Aforementioned vulnerabilities researches are related to the web vulnerabilities [20]. Although these vulnerabilities have been reported for a long time, they have received little attention. Moreover, researchers did not consider how to ana- lyze the vulnerabilities of these Apps if it is packed [21]–[23]. To the best of our knowledge, there is little effective analysis on aforementioned vulnerabilities. There is a very serious problem that many vulnerabilities reported early still exist in latest Apps, even in the same App. The main reason is that there is no feasible and complete vulnerability veriﬁcation workﬂows for developers. In additional， more and more web functions are used in Apps [24], these functions may also increase new vulnerabilities of Apps. Users send their infor- mation through the network in the process of Apps，which makes it is particular important for Apps to ensure(assure) their security. In this paper, our target of vulnerabilities are related to web functions. By manual analysis of 400 Apps, we ﬁnd the vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of APIs accounted for the majority, and the most of vulnerabilities caused by API misuse are WRCEV, WBCVV, ICV and ACOCDV. So we chose these four vulnerabilities as our study goals. At the same time, we divide the above four vulnerabilities into three categories based on their behaviors: Overridden method(Cat1:OM), Use unsafe settings(Cat2:USS) and Data leakage of sensitive information(Cat3:DLSI). Contributions. Based on the above analysis, we explore the severity of these vulnerabilities and perform the comprehen- sive study on the four vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of APIs and form an analysis methodology for each category of vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate them, we propose corresponding improvement recommendations. Based on the methodology, we propose a vulnerability veriﬁcation work- ﬂow for each vulnerability. In order to verify the effectiveness of our analysis methodology in large-scale Apps on the Internet. Based on our ﬁndings, we propose a vulnerability detection tool, named VulArcher. It can detect the above four vulnerabilities in packed or unpacked Android Apps,and the'}, {'id': 'chunk-9', 'content': 'average accuracy rate is 91%.The main contributions are as follows: (1) For the four vulnerabilities that are caused by the mis- use of APIs, we divide them into three categories based on their behaviors. we perform the comprehensive study on them and form an analysis methodology for each vulnerability， which can help researchers to discover other vulnerabilities in the three categories. Based on the analysis, we provide improvement recommendations to mitigate the vulnerability threat. (2) Based on the methodology, we propose a vulnerabilityAn Android API is an interface provided to developers to invoke system services, making App development more ef- ﬁcient and convenient. Here are a few Android APIs related to this paper. WebView is an Android component that displays web- pages and supports the execution of JavaScript. And its APIs are designed to customize WebView for developers.

(3) In order to verify our methodologies in large-scale Apps, we propose a static and scalable vulnerabilities de- tection tool based on our ﬁndings for vulnerability analy- sis，VulArcher. We download 6,177 Android Apps contain- ing transactions from the Internet, which are the latest version in 2018. After our random manual veriﬁcation of the results of VulArcher, it shows that the average accuracy rate is 91%. In addition, VulArcher can also detect the vulnerabilities on packed Apps. By adding rules in a conﬁguration ﬁle, Vu- lArcher can detect other categories of vulnerabilities. We will share VulArcher at https://buptnsrclab.github.io/blog/2020/ 01/03/vularcher- site- launched. II. BACKGROUD A. ANDROID APP OVERVIEW An Android App ﬁle is a compressed ﬁle that contains AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle, certiﬁcate ﬁles, dex ﬁle, static re- source ﬁles and so on. 1) Androidmanifest.xml, which deﬁned and included in every App, describes the name, version, permissions, component name and other information of the App. 2) Certiﬁcate ﬁles hold the signature information that ensures the integrity of the App. 3) Dex ﬁle is an executable ﬁle, which contains all the operating instructions and runtime data of an the App. Its structure is as follows: (1) Header: containing metadata, and a body which contains the majority of the data. . (2) String_ids: recording the offsets of each string in the data area. (3) Type_ids: recording the string indexs for each type. (4) Proto_ids: recording the declaration strings of methods, return type strings, parameter lists. (5) Field_ids: recording the classes, type, and method name which belongs to. (6) Method_ids: recording the classes’ name, declara- tion and the name of the methods and other informa- tion. (7) Class_defs: containing the type, inheritance hierar- chy, access metadata, and other class metadata . (8) Data: containing data of each classes. 4) Static resource ﬁles that exist in the res folder mainly contain pictures, audios and layout ﬁles of the App. B.

It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on Apps. In the use of such a network transmission protocol, the App veriﬁes whether the certiﬁcate on the server side is a compliant certiﬁcate, so that both sides of the communication can be trusted. Apps use the X509TrustManager class to trust certiﬁcates. The weakness that the App improper certiﬁcate validation is described in CWE-295, when a certiﬁcate is invalid, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the- middle (MITM) attack. The weakness code is shown in Fig 1. We extract 100 Apps in the dataset, After manual analyzing, we ﬁnd that 81 of these Apps with the weakness, as shown in Table 4. Hence we analysis this weakness in the paper.Certiﬁcate veriﬁcation APIs are used for HTTPs commu- nication process of Apps, through which developers can cus- tomize the verﬁﬁcation rules. TABLE 2 summarizes related APIs. SDK is a set of tools provided by an organization, and are used to develop Android applications. For example, SDK pro- vided by Alibaba help developers use the company’s services. TABLE 3 shows APIs in Alibaba OSS Cloud service SDK. The WebView component supports certiﬁcate veriﬁcation when loading webpages with HTTPs protocol. As described in CVE-2014-5531, when an App is displaying data through WebView, at the same time, the function of verifying the validity of the certiﬁcate in this component does not work. In this case, the App will be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, And attacks can obtain sensitive information via a crafted certiﬁcate. As shown in Fig 2, the WebView is used to load the webpage, when the certiﬁcate veriﬁcation fails, it still allows the data exchange between the App and the server side of the crafted certiﬁcate. Table 4 shows that we ﬁnd 86 Apps in 100 have this vulnerability, so it is worthwhile to analyze the vulnerability in detail. 3) WebView remote code execution vulnerability According to Google [25], there are 2 billion active devices on Android monthly, and close to 10% are running in An- droid 4.3 or lower versions and more than 4% are running in Android 4.1 or lower versions. That indicates that JS-to-Java interface vulnerabilities may still affect hundreds of millions of users. Table 1 describes some of the APIs for the Web-'}, {'id': 'chunk-11', 'content': 'View component. The addJavascriptInterface(Object object, String name) function provides a way to bridge between JavaScript and Java. It is equivalent to inject a Java object into the environment of JavaScript. So the JavaScript code running in the WebView can call all the public methods of the Java object by the object name. However, in this scenario, proper security measures are not used, which can lead to WRCEV as described in CVE-2014-1939, an attacker canIII. CASE STUDY A.

ACOCDV is a new vulnerability with wide inﬂuence in 2017. Alibaba cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a massive, safe and highly reliable cloud storage service provided by Al- ibaba. As shown in Fig 4, when developers use Alibaba cloud OSS service framework by the SDK, sensitive information, such as AccessKey and AccessKeySecret, is directly written into the code (for data protection, we perform sensitive information erasure processing). An attacker can easily get sensitive information through reversing the App, it causes data leakage from developers on cloud services. The data in Table 4 shows that the vulnerability the existence rate of the vulnerability is 20%, so the vulnerability of data leakage should be taken seriously.java/android/webkit/BrowserFrame.java in Android 4.4 and earlier uses the addJavascriptInterface in conjunction with creating an object of SearchBoxImpl class, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary Java code by leveraging access to the SearchBoxJavaBridge_ interface at certain Android version. An App in the above environment, when the WebView component uses the addJavascriptInterface(Object object, String name) API to establish the connection between JavaScript and Java without security restrictions. JavaScript in the webpage not only has permission to call Java object‘s methods in its runtime environment, but to execute Android system commands. The above description of the vulnerability is'}, {'id': 'chunk-12', 'content': 'summarized that when the App runtime environment belongs to Android version 4.4 or below, if the WebView addJavascriptInter- face(Object object, String name) API is used in the App and the developer has not added security restrictions, an attacker can build malicious JavaScript code perform instruction exe- cution on the App. VulnerabilityPOC (1) File MD5: cdc18db0cad812225d8412be4e27182b (2) version: 4.2 (3) Exploit: The App supports running under Android version 4.4.

Viaing a MITM attack, we forged mali- cious JavaScript code into the webpage. Malicious JavaScript code executes the command \"ls - al /MNT/sdcard/\" to read ﬁle information in sdcard. As shown in Fig 6b, malicious JavaScript normally runs on the vulnerable App, which reads the ﬁle information from the sdcard directory of the Android device. It indicates that this vulnerability exists and can be exploited in the App. Insight. When developers use the addJavascriptInterface (Object object, String name) API to call a web page. As summarized in Table 5, the functions of removing the risk in- terface should be added to limit the permission of JavaScript code. They can eliminate the WRCEV in Apps. As shown in TABLE 6, the characteristics of vulnerabilities are summarized after a comprehensive case study of each vulnerability. In addition, after a lot of manual analysis of Apps of above vulnerabilities. We divided the four vulner- abilities into three categories, and generalized the analysis methods and characteristics of each type of vulnerabilityAlibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a secure and reliable cloud Storage Service provided by Alibaba. When the service is used in an Android App, the APIs provided by the SDK of the service need to be called in the App. However, developers usually simply copy the ofﬁcial sample code and don’t consider the security weekness of program- ming. Fig 7 is the demo code provided by the Alibaba cloud. Attackers can obtain'}, {'id': 'chunk-13', 'content': 'this set of credentials by using the OSS management tool to get the data in the service easily.

When constructing an object, this method directly invoke the ac- cessKeyId and accessKeySecret, and both of these sensitive values are hard coded by the developer in the program, thus it causes the weakness of sensitive information.

The details are described as follows. Improper certiﬁcate validation (ICV). An App uses the method of checkServerTrusted. No certiﬁcate veriﬁcation operation is performed in it, or in this method, only the expiration time of the certiﬁcate is veriﬁed, and no other information is veriﬁed. WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulnerability (WBCVV). An App uses the WebView API for certiﬁcate veriﬁcation, but the method onReceivedSslError(WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error) which is for handling the exception certiﬁcate does not perform any pro- cessing. This causes the abnormal certiﬁcate to pass the veriﬁcation. Vulnerability in overridden method (OM). The functions that lead to the above two vulnerabilities have common char- acteristics in analytical methods. These are subclass methods provided by the Android system to developers to customize the strong validation logic, and the parent class methods they inherit have the vulnerable logic in default. Developers don’t strictly follow the security speciﬁcations to customize VOLUME 4, 20167As shown in Fig 10, the working process of VulArcher can be divided into the following steps: Decompilation. For an App, VulArcher decompresses it to obtain the classes.dex ﬁle which contains the source code, the AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle which contains component in- formation, permissions and the resource ﬁles. VulArcher reverses the classes.dex based on Androgurd [28]. Through this process, It obtains the classes and methods in the source code of the App. Also it decompiles the AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle to obtain registered component information and conﬁgu- ration information. Packer Identition. VulArcher recognizes whether an App is packed according to formula (1) and (2). AC indicates the number of all components registered by the App, and CC indicates the number of classes in classes.dex which can obtain from the AC. Because the packed App almost hides all components and other logic codes, classes.dex does not con- tain these information. Some packing methods have signaturethe security policy code. The analysis method for this type of vulnerability is described in TABLE 6. An App has a overridden method that is to do the security validation, and its inherited parent method is a weak logic in default. If the method of the App is not written with strong veriﬁcation, then the App is vulnerable. WebView remote code execution vulnerability (WRCEV). There are three elements that can cause an App to have this vulnerability. First, the App needs to support to run on An- droid version 4.4 or below. Second, the App uses WebView’s API addJavascriptInterface(Object Object, String name) to allow JavaScript to run Java. Finally, the App does not add an API as shown in TABLE 5 to remove the weekness interface in the context of using the above API. Vulnerability of using unsafe APIs (USS). For an App, it uses a potentially vulnerable API, and the developer does not perform codes to protect against the vulnerability'}, {'id': 'chunk-15', 'content': 'in the call- ing link and the context of it. Because some vulnerabilities are related to the Android environment, API level required for Apps is also one of the elements to identify the vulnerability. We can combine the above elements to determine whether the vulnerability exists. Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability (ACOCDV). For an App that uses the API OSSPlainTextAK- SKCredentialProvider provided by the Alibaba OSS SDK to create credential information with server, its secretKey needed in the method is hard coded in the program. This causes the existence of information disclosure vulnerability. Data leakage of sensitive information (DLSI). The analy- sis and characteristics of this category vulnerabiliy is shown in TABLE 6. An App has an invoke method that uses sen- sitive information. The object of the sensitive information is traced to determine whether it is hard-coded in the App. If it is hard- coded in it then the vulnerability exists. The algorithm of building TCFG.p (4) (5) (6)ﬁles, ie. libexe*.so and libexecma**.so. In order to further clarify packing methods, VulArcher uses the ﬁngerprint to identify the detailed packing type and version of the App. F= (1) { ≥App (2) Unpacking. At present, more and more Apps are packed. Static analysis can not directly get the real code of the packed Apps. This causes static detection to fail to analyze vulnera- bilities of such Apps. Therefore, the analysis of packed Apps should be carried out by unpacking method, for extracting the original code of Apps. The unpacking method used in this system DexX [27] is a result of our previous research. It can handle the six packers, such as Ali [29], Baidu [30], Bangcle [31], Tencent [32], Qihoo 360 Mobile [33], and ijiami [34]. This paper does not elaborate too much for the method. Building Taint Path. VulArcher creates a taint control ﬂow graph(TCFG) of a classes.dex, the algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. VulArcher creates a control ﬂow graph(CFG) of the classes.dex. the set V of p nodes in CFG is shown in formula (3). Each vk contains the package name(pk), class name(ck) and method(mk). As shown in formula (4), the set IA of m interested APIs is a subset of V . For each iAj, we follow the heuristic method to ﬁnd its taint path tpj, it’s shown in formula (5). V ′ is a subset of V , the points in V′ are related to the control ﬂow of iAj. If vk has a control ﬂow to vw, we think there is a taint control ﬂow relationship from vk to vw <vk, vw>, we denote the set of all the above relationships as E′. As shown in formula (6), TCFG is composed of all tpj(j = 1, ....., m). V={vk=(pkgk,ck,mk)|k=1,...,p} (3) Algorithm 1IV. VULARCHER-A TOOL TO DETECT VULNERABILITIES A.

In this way, the entire vulnerability search process is fast and accurate. An App contains many classes and methods, if we iterate through each method to search vulnerabilities and weak- nesses, it will certainly affect the efﬁciency of detection. So we ﬁrst built the TCFG of the App, recording classes and methods that contain suspicious interesting paths. When we are looking for vulnerabilities, we can use the heuristic-based approach described in Algorithm 2 to ﬁnd out if a vulnera- bility exists. The interestSet in the algorithm represents allDetection. VulArcher uses the rules of above vulnerabil- ities and the TCFG of an App generated in the Building Taint Path for vulnerability judgment. In order to detect vulnerabilities faster, we propose a heuristic vulnerability search algorithm as described in Algorithm 2, so that we can avoid matching vulnerability rules of all App code. For tpj, VulArcher extracts its context slices(csj). R is a set of vulnerability rules. The input to function f(.) is R and CS. If the m matchs the vr, the App is commented with the vulnerability which vr represents. CS={csj|j=1,...,r} (7) Nowadays there are more and more vulnerability detection tools. To some certain extent, they can detect some vulnera- bilities and weaknesses. But they do not provide developers with some way to reproduce vulnerabilities. This is the reason why more and more vulnerabilities are ignored by de- velopers, as a result, many Apps still have vulnerabilities that have been reported for a long time. In this paper, we provide semi-automated veriﬁcation methods and workﬂow for the vulnerabilities and weaknesses we analyzed. This work can verify the detection results of VulArcher and provides readers with clear methods of vulnerabilities’ veriﬁcations. A veriﬁcation method for man-in-middle attack vul- nerability caused by weak certiﬁcate veriﬁcation. Fig 11 depicts the attack architecture for this weakness. First, we set up the environment to enable Burpsuite [35] to block all network trafﬁc from mobile. We write a script basedsensitive APIs and methods that may cause vulnerabilities in the App. FR represents a collection of rules for vulnerability ﬁxes and TR represents the set of rules that trigger the vul- nerability. The algorithm ﬁrst obtains a suspected vulnerable point in interestSet, then in the already constructed TCFG, it constructs the relevant slice content of all objects and variables in the point, that is, contextSlice. It uses a heuristic search algorithm to search in contextSlice. If there is a rule for repairing the vulnerability in the slice, then the App does not have the vulnerability. Otherwise, if it ﬁnds the rule for triggering the vulnerability in slice through the search algorithm, then it records the complete path information and slice of the vulnerability of the App. R Vul, notV ul,{vr1, vr2, . . . , vrn if vr is matched in CS other w ise= } B.

Our experiments are performed in'}, {'id': 'chunk-17', 'content': 'the following environ- ment: The CPU is e5-2640v4, the memory is 32G, system is Linux 64 and python 2.7. In this paper, the main types of Apps we focus on are ﬁnancial, shopping, and browser. We downloaded a total of 6177 Apps from the Baidu [36], Wandoujia [37], Qihoo [38] and Huawei [39] App Stores, which were released from January to August 2018. Of these, 3,160 Apps are in the ﬁnancial category, 2,954 Apps are in the shopping category, and the remaining 63 Apps are in the browser category. Table 7 shows the distribution of three types of Apps from January to August 2018. It includes classiﬁcation by sample category of Apps, classiﬁcation by time. Table 8 shows the distribution of three types of Apps’ size.on Burpsuite, which is mainly responsible for analyzing the trafﬁc information of mobile, extracting the Host and body and sending it to the server. The web service module is mainly responsible for auto installing Apps and recycling the results of analyzing network trafﬁc, also, determining whether the App is attacked by MIMT automately. A veriﬁcation method for WRCEV. As shown in Fig 12, our veriﬁcation method is mainly to inject malicious JavaScript code in to the App’s network trafﬁc by MIMT. We use Burpsuite to block all trafﬁc sent by the mobile and in- jecting the written malicious JavaScript code in the response. If the JavaScript can successfully execute malicious code, the code will send a record to the web service to record whether the App exists the vulnerability. A veriﬁcation method for ACOCDV. We use the Jeb to reverse the App, and we look for the code module initialized by OSSClient in the reverse smali code. We ﬁnd out whether initialize method by using plaintext accessKey and secretKey. We get these keys, and use the OSSUtils to connect the service.1: Input: interestSet, FR, TR {interestSet in the algorithm represents all sensitive APIs and methods that may cause vulnerabilities in the App. FR represents a collection of rules for vulnerability ﬁxes and TR represents the set of rules that the vulnerability triggers.} 2: Output:output(path,contextSlice){Thisstoresthedetailedcodesnippet of the vulnerability and the path where the vulnerability is located.} 3: INITIALIZE output(path,contextSlice)=∅ {FindPath can ﬁnd the caller paths in the APK through a function that is suspected of a vulnerability.} 4: for each ti 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: ∈ InterestSet do path⇐ FindPath(TCFG,ti) contextSlice formation by the path.} if(FR= if ⇐ GetContextSlice(path) {Geting detailed function in- 6 ∅)and(TR=6 ∅)then HeuSearch(contextSlice,TR) == True and HeuSearch(contextSlice,FR) == False then output(path,contextSlice) endif endif ifFR=6 ∅then ifHeuSearch(contextSlice,FR)==Truethen continue else output(path,contextSlice) endif endif ifTR=6 ∅then ifHeuSearch(contextSlice,TR)==Truethen output(path,contextSlice) else continue endif endif 26: end for 27: return output(path,contextSlice)358 291 8 657213 224 4 441391 376 3 770526 557 4 1087435 467 19 921455 475 9 939504 706 14 122472 64 2 138 ≥ 116 108 0 224S F B TJan Feb Mar Apr May JunJulAug 0-5 5-10 10-15 15-20 20-25 25-30 30-35 35-40 40-45 45-50 S418 F511 B677 736 510 685 492 408 10 910 235 275 194 177 2 373 130 101 92'}, {'id': 'chunk-18', 'content': '65 55 58 35 36 2 7321 15 7 2 1 2 1 T95014281202 512 232 159 114 50TABLE 7 – The distribution of three types of Apps from January to August 2018(’S’ refer to ’Shop’, ’F’ refers to ’Financial’, ’B’ refers to ’Browser’ and ’T’ refers to ’Total’) TABLE 8 – Three types of Apps’ size distribution(Mb)(’S’ refers to ’Shop’, ’F’ refers to ’Financial’, ’B’ refers to ’Browser’ and ’T’ refers to ’Total’) V.

ANALYZE THE RESULTS TABLE 10 shows the details of the test results of all the Apps. We divide the samples vulnerability type into two categories according to whether or not is packed. It can be seen that even if the App is packed, vulnerabilities cannot be ﬁxed. Through the results, WBCVV and ICV have a high ratio, because most of the Apps’ network communication protocols now use HTTPs, developers use APIs to develop these functions, and ignore the security of certiﬁcate veriﬁcation for the convenience of the development process. WRCEV is the least, there may be a direct relationship with the current Apps that rarely supports version of Android 4.4 and below. Finding 1: Although the WRCEV was ﬁrst reported in 2014, there is still a 4.7% Apps in the currently released browser Apps. Finding 2: When the JS-to-Java reﬂection function in WebView is used in Apps, it is able to strictly limit the Android version to be greater than 17, and use the interface function shown in TABLE 5. Manually Verﬁfy. We randomly select samples with and without vulnerabilities in the detection results. We manually analyze those samples. For those which need a user account to use, and these accounts are not free to register externally, these are not the scope we consider. The analysis results are shown in TABLE 9, it is showed that VulArcher detects ACOCDV with high accuracy. Finding 3: When we do the MITM, we ﬁnd that many Apps not only do not carry out certiﬁcate veriﬁcation, but also transmit sensitive data such as user name and password in plaintext. It is very easy to cause the leakage of sensitive information. So it is necessary to encrypt sensitive informa- tion. Finding 4: The detection accuracy for ACOCDV can reach 100%, and for WBCVV can reach 95%. Also the accuracy is lightly lower and can reach 87% for the other two vulnera- bilities. VulArcher can help developers detect vulnerabilities before Apps are released. It can avoid releasing Apps with the above vulnerabilities. The irrelevance of vulnerabilities and sizes of Apps. Fig 13 shows the number of vulnerabilities in Apps with different sizes. It can be seen that the same category of vulnerabilities have almost the same probability distribution in different sized apps.'}, {'id': 'chunk-19', 'content': 'Both WBCVV and ICV have a high percentage in Apps of different sizes. Finding 5: The number and the type of vulnerabilities in Apps are independent of the size of them.Fig 14 shows the probability of vulnerabilities for each of the categories of Apps. ACOCDV does not exist in the browser Apps, because they do not need to use this service to store a large number of images. The reason that the percentage of WRCEV in these Apps is slightly higher than the other two types of Apps is most of these Apps use the WebView component and many of them support for the Android 4.4 version. Finding 6: More and more Apps face the vulnerability of MITM, because developers do not validate certiﬁcate for convenience. So certiﬁcate validation must be done strictly in the development. Finding 7: Although Alibaba OSS SDK has released new instructions to circumvent this credential information leak [40], results in Fig 14 shows that many Apps still have this vulnerability. This means that Apps should be timely updated the SDKversion to ﬁx the vulnerability. The trend of the vulnerability. Fig 15 shows the trend of probability of vulnerabilities for Apps in each month fromThe relationship between vulnerabilities and cate- gories.11TABLE 10 – Summary table of all sample detection results.(’P’ refers to ’Probability of vulnerability(%)’; ’ICV’ refers to ’Improper certiﬁcate validation, ’WBCVV’ refers to ’WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulnerability’, ’WRCEV’ refers to ’WebView remote code execution vulnerability’ and ’ACOCDV’ refers to ’Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability’) Packed Vulnerability VulnerabilityApps Summary 79 28 4285 3936P 1.278 0.453 69.370 63.720Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No70 9 19 9 2851 1434 2594 1342ACOCDV WRCEV WBCVV ICV We download the Apps to analyze the four types of vulnera- bilities, but the Apps was two years ago.

Computing cost. For an App, the memory consumption is 400M, CPU utilization is 40%. Scalability. VulArcher supports the rules of vulnerabilities to detect them. Hence, for a new vulnerability, VulArcher only need to konw the vulnerability rule to complete the detection of the new vulnerability.January to August in 2018. It can be intuitively reﬂected that there are vulnerabilities and weekneses in the monthly release of Apps, and the number of vulnerabilities does not decline over time. Finding 8: As shown in Fig 15, the trend of vulnerabilities tends to be in a stable state. This shows that various vulnera- bilities still exist in Apps and developers do not mitigate these vulnerabilities.The study of Android vulnerabilities can be divided into two aspects, one is about the Apps and the other is about the Android OS. Li et al. [14] just conducted a detail analysis of the vul- nerabilities that will occur in the music Apps. The'}, {'id': 'chunk-20', 'content': 'music Apps that are analyzed mainly produce man-in-the-middle hijacking attacks when communicating with servers. Qian et al. [23] proposed a structure called app property graph (APG) for Android vulnerabilities. Based on this feature representation method, a detection tool is proposed for ﬁve common vulnerabilities. But they did not give workﬂows for the veriﬁcation of the vulnerabilities. Chen et al. [41] manually analysed several OAuth providers for Apps and determined how differences between the Apps and browser environments lead to the OAuth vulnerability. Wu et al. [1] proposed a detection method for the confused deputy vul- nerability in Android applications based on features of An- droidManifest.xml ﬁle and Control Flow Graph (CFG). Fang et al. [5] studyed an input validation vulnerability in Android inter-component communication. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the incomplete security veriﬁcation mechanism of Apps developers. Yang et al. [10] used a combination of static and dynamic methods to analyze the App’s dynamic loading vulnerability. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the insecure veriﬁcation on the loaded executable ﬁle. Yang et al. [20] studyed about security issues caused by mixed postMessage Origin Stripping Vulnerability(OSV) in Apps. Ranganath et al. [42] proposed a detection tool for supporting large-scale Android vulnerabilities, they didn’t conduct analysis method for vulnerabilities. Farhang et al. [43] focused on how different when vendors deal with An- droid vulnerabilities.The vulnerability results detected by VulArcher contain both third-party components and the App itself. At present, we regard these two aspects as all the vulnerabilities of the App. If we want to distinguish the vulnerability results. We can organize a third-party component library, which contains information such as the package name of the component. The vulnerability results detected by VulArcher contains the package name and class name of a vulnerability, so we use the package name and the class name to go back to the component library to check whether the vulnerability belongs to the App itself or third-party components. C. VULARCHER PERFORMANCE VI. DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONSVII. RELATED W ORK12This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No.2018YFB0804703.Other studies explored different vulnerabilities from we studied. Feng et al. [44] analyzed some vulnerabilities related to Binderin Android, and proposed an automated tool for detecting this type of vulnerabilities from the analysis of the causes of the vulnerabilities. Mario et al. [45] analyzed Android system vulnerabilities by using the Bulletin re- source. Zhang et al. [21] mainly studyed the Android system- level vulnerabilities. Through analysis rules and results, they proposed a detection tool for this type of vulnerabilities. Table 13 gives the the attack results of “Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability ”. Table 14 gives the attack results of “WebView remote code execution vulnerability”. Since there are no more than 100 Apps for the above two types of vulnerabilities, we have all analyzed. Table 11 gives a detailed description of 98 Apps randomly selected which were detected “WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulner- ability”. As Table 12 shown, we selected 99 Apps that were taged as “Improper certiﬁcate validation”, and we recorded whether or not it can be attacked for each App.We deeply analyzed the four'}, {'id': 'chunk-21', 'content': 'kinds of vulnerabilities on a data set with more than 6000 Android Apps. The aforementioned vulnerabilities are ACOCDV, WRCEV, WBCVV and ICV. We found that webview and HTTPs are existed in most of ﬁnance and shopping apps. According to this, attackers can easily perform MITM. As for WRCEV which has been disclosed for a long time, it still exist in browser Apps, because developers lack the methods of vulnerability identiﬁcation and security development awareness. Apps that use Alibaba Cloud OSS services, information leakage vulnerability of Alibaba cloud OSS credentials is caused by the weak secure awareness of developers. We developed a vulnerability detection tool, VulArcher. The experiments show that it can automatically detect the above vulnerabilities, and has good scalability. One of vulnerabilities which VulArcher detected had been included in China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) ID(CNVD- 2017-23282). It detected more than 6000 Apps and found nearly 3000 Apps with the above vulnerabilities. and we have manually veriﬁed the accuracy of results among nearly 300 Apps. The source codes of VulArcher and sam- ple data presented in this paper can be utilized by further researchers. We incentivize this by making our data publicly available [46]. APPENDIXVIII.

            "['like Twitter consider embedding the third-party secrets in the code as best practice. ○ For services which don’t provide a per-user authentication service, it’s possible to spin up your own server that handles this. ● For services that recommend embedding third-party secrets in the app, expect the secrets to be extracted and abused by attackers. The goal for such situations is to mitigate the negative effects of the abuse. Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Example code private static String SECRET_KEY = \"MySecretAESKey99\"; private static byte[] encrypt(String inputText) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(SECRET_KEY.getBytes(), \"AES\")); return cipher.doFinal(inputText.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")); } See also: CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Auditing tips ● Look for all uses of APIs in the javax.crypto package ● Look for all embedded popular cryptography libraries ● Audit initialization and use of discovered cryptography APIs Embedded cryptography secrets The problem: Applications that use embedded crypto secrets are susceptible to simple data decryption attacks. Remediation ● Understand what you are trying to protect from whom ○ In many cases using embedded secrets is actually fine ● Avoid rolling your own crypto by abstracting what you’re trying to do and using a ready-made library for your purpose Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Example code String url = \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\"; url += \"?client_id=XXXX\"; url += \"&redirect_url=com%2Emy%2Eapp%3A%2F%2Foauth\"; url += \"&response_type=token\"; // Use Implicit Grant =( url += \"&scope=email\"; Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url)); startActivity(i); See also: CWE-??? (???) Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Auditing tips ● Search for OAuth endpoint URLs being sent to the browser and check what parameters are being passed ○ Implicit grant is always bad ○ If using Authz flow, check for PKCE use ○ If using PKCE, check that it is not predictable Leaking OAuth tokens The problem: OAuth Implicit Grant and Authz (without PKCE) flows expose tokens that can be used to create fraudulent requests. Remediation ● Use a platform-integrated authentication flow rather than the browser. ○ Much more foolproof. ● If using OAuth in the browser, use the Authz flow with PKCE ○ Make sure you aren’t using a hardcoded secret or nonce Private file access Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Example code public class FileUploader extends Activity { protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { String path = getIntent().getExtras().getString(“path”); String url = getIntent().getExtras().getString(“url”); uploadFile(path, url); } } See also: CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Information (\\'Privacy Violation\\')) Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Auditing tips ● Look for files stored on external storage which is world-readable by default. ● Look for files stored in internal storage whose access attributes are changed to make them world-accessible.', '● Look for unsanitized file or path names that are supplied by potential attackers. Private data sharing The problem: Applications may leak private data to other apps or attackers in obvious and subtle ways. Remediation ● Store files in internal storage with default access attribute unless you want to intentionally share them with other apps. ● Limit the ability of users to supply their own path or file names. ● Verify that the canonical path of a file or path points to an expected path. ○ Watch out for TOCTOU issues. Symlinks can change at any time. Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Example code OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(PUBLIC_DIRECTORY + \"/Download/\" + filename); See also: CWE Category 21 (Pathname Traversal and Equivalence Errors) Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Auditing tips ● Find any kind of path or file operations with variable input and see if they rely on user-provided input. Private data overwrite due to path traversal The problem: Applications that don’t sanitize attacker-provided directory paths may be susceptible to overwrite their internal files with attacker-provided files. Remediation ● Limit the ability of users to supply their own path or file names. ● Verify that the canonical path of a file or path points to an expected path right before doing file operations on the file or path. Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Example code InputStream is = new FileInputStream(zipFilePath); ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(is)); ZipEntry ze; while ((ze = zis.getNextEntry()) != null) { outputFileName = ze.getName(); writeToFile(outputFileName, zis); } See also: CWE ??? (???) Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Auditing tips ● Find all uses of APIs in the java.util.zip.* package or third-party zipping libraries. ● Understand whether user-provided ZIP files are being unzipped by the code. Private data overwrite due to ZIP file traversal The problem: Applications that unzip archive files without sanitizing the target file paths of files inside the archives are susceptible to overwriting their internal files with attacker-provided files. Remediation ● Validate that the canonical path of unzipped files points to the real directory to unzip to. ○ A Google search for “android zip path traversal” will lead to examples. Unprotected app parts Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Example code <activity android:name=\"com.mypackage.SomeActivity\"> ... <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"com.mypackage.OPEN\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /> </intent-filter> ... </activity> See also: CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by', 'network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Auditing tips ● In addition to the auditing tips for finding the use of insecure network protocols: ○ Understand which user data and application data is potentially sensitive ○ Audit whether any network connections over insecure protocols send potentially sensitive data to network endpoints Data transmission over insecure protocols The problem: Sending sensitive data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Remediation ● Exactly the same as for the use of insecure network connections Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Example code URL url = new URL(\"http://www.mysite.com?user=bugdroid&pwd=androidnumber one\"); HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream(); See also: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Auditing tips ● In addition to the auditing tips for finding the use of insecure network protocols: ○ Understand which login information the app is working with ○ Audit whether any network connections over insecure protocols send login information to network endpoints Authentication over insecure protocols The problem: Sending login information over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data. Remediation ● In general the same as for the use of insecure network connections. ● Authentication should probably be handled through a common, security-vetted method such as OAuth. Custom authentication schemes are likely to get more wrong than just insecure network protocols. Cryptography and authentication Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Example code ParseTwitterUtils.initialize( \"CONSUMER KEY\", \"CONSUMER SECRET\"); flag{a0a6cb3b4bc98bf2a34b7aed76aebf53} See also: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Auditing tips ● Compile a list of interesting public APIs and create regular expressions to find keys or secrets through grep. ● Compile a list of interesting public APIs and look for their package names in apps. ● Grep for “key”, “password”, “login”, “secret” and such. Embedded third-party secrets The problem: Apps that embed third-party secrets such as Twitter API keys or AWS authentication tokens can trivially have these secrets extracted and abused by attackers. Remediation ● Follow best practices for the used API as documented in their help center. ○ Some APIs encourage you to embed their secrets in the app as a secret compromise will have limited negative effects. ● Some third-party services offer more secure alternatives to embedding credentials in the app (such as Amazon and Google) while others', 'that grants content:// URI access to their app. Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Remediation ● Whenever sending an Intent created from untrusted data ○ Check the class name and package name of the target component or… ○ Check the signing key of the app that owns the target component ○ Verify that Intents don’t contain FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION or FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Example code android.content.Intent intent = new android.content.Intent(); intent.putExtra(\"SMS\", smsMessage); intent.setAction(\"my.app.sms\"); intent.setClass(context, my.app.SmsHandler); sendBroadcast(intent); See also: CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Auditing tips ● Look for all intent broadcasts that do not have a target set ○ Called implicit broadcasts ○ Lacks setComponent, setClass, setClassName or an explicit constructor Implicit broadcasts (sending) The problem: Applications that send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target may have these broadcasts intercepted by malicious apps on the same device. Remediation ● Turn as many implicit intents into explicit intents. ● For the intents that cannot be made explicit understand that they can be intercepted ○ Think through the worst case scenarios. ○ Document why these intents are implicit. Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Example code final class Receiver extends BroadcastReceiver { public final void onReceive(Context ctx, Intent intent) { if (verifyPackageName(getCallingActivity())) { doSomethingSecret(); } } } Don’t actually know what verifyPackageName would look like. See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Auditing tips ● Find all receivers in the app ○ Look at manifest file and for Context.registerReceiver calls. ○ Non-exported receivers are safe as they can only receive broadcasts from inside the app. Implicit broadcasts (receiving) The problem: Applications that accept broadcasts without checking the sender may accept maliciously crafted broadcasts sent from malicious apps on the same device. Remediation ● Make as many receivers as possible non-exported. ● For receivers that have to stay exported, treat all inputs as untrusted. Other Everything else that doesn’t fit anywhere Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to get URL parsing and verification wrong. Example code // Just one of many ways to get URL verification wrong if (uri.getHost().endsWith(\"mywebsite.com\")) { webView.loadUrl(uri.toString()); } See also: CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme) Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to', 'get URL parsing and verification wrong. Auditing tips ● Find every instance of URLs being used in an app ● Narrow it down to those that work on user-controlled input ● Narrow it down to those that are used to branch between different code paths ○ Could be any part of the URL, not just the host name Incorrect URL verification The problem: Apps that rely on URL parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trusted server may be susceptible to many different ways to get URL parsing and verification wrong. Remediation ● Read and understand https://hackerone.com/reports/431002 ○ “Golden techniques to bypass host validations in Android apps” ● Create a library that follows best practices and always use that when trying to verify URLs Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Example code Intent intent = getIntent(); String url = intent.getStringExtra(“url”); WebView myWebview = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.foo); // url points to the cookies database, is a javascript: // url, or is a phishing url myWebview.loadUrl(url); See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Auditing tips ● Find calls to loadUrl and evaluateJavascript in your app. ● Verify that inputs to these functions are trusted or sanitized (or both). ● Check for dangerous WebView settings like setAllowFileAccess(true) ○ Files can contain *both* malicious scripts and sensitive user data (the cookies database). Cross-app scripting The problem: Apps that load untrusted URLs from other apps into their WebViews that match a certain form (e.g., javascript: or file:///path/to/private) allow malicious JavaScript code execution. Remediation ● Disable WebView file access unless it is needed. ○ Use setAllowFileAccess(false) ● Target up-to-date SDK versions to prevent javascript: URLs ● Make sure that app-private Activities aren’t exported by accident ○ Creating an intent-filter exports the component by default! ● Verify that URLs from external sources are safe to load before calling loadUrl() ○ URL validation can be tricky as you just learned. ○ Think carefully about what URLs are acceptable. Same-origin-policy does not protect against phishing. Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Example code PythonInterpreter interpreter = new PythonInterpreter(); interpreter.exec( \"from shutil import copyfile\\\\n copyfile(\\\\\"passwords.bin\\\\\", \\\\\"/sdcard/passwords.bin\\\\\" ); See also: CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Auditing tips ● Look for indicators of scripting languages ○ Common interpreters such as Python inside the app. ○ Interpreters may be hidden in file formats like PDF (Javascript). ○ Look for Android and Java sandboxing libraries. ● Check whether these interpreters allow untrusted input. Incorrect sandboxing of scripting language The problem: Embedding', 'other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Auditing tips ● Understand what conditions can lead to activities being exported ○ android:exported attribute ○ Presence of intent filters auto-exports activities ● Go through list of activities declared in manifest XML file ○ Find those that are exported Unprotected activities The problem: Exported activities can be started by other apps on the device which may break user workflow assumptions, including ways that break security boundaries. Remediation ● Explicitly mark components with android:exported=\"false\" in the application manifest ● Use android:protectionLevel=\"signature\" in the xml manifest to restrict access to applications signed by you Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Example code <service android:name=\"com.myapp.service\"> ... <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"com.myapp.START_SERVICE\" /> </intent-filter> ... </service> See also: CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Auditing tips ● Same as for unprotected activities Unprotected services The problem: Applications that export services allow malicious apps on the device to start those services. Remediation ● Same as for unprotected activities Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Example code <permission android:label=\"@string/write_contact_permission\" android:name=\"my.app.permission.write\" /> <provider android:label=\"@string/contacts\" android:name=\"my.app.ContactsProvider\" android:writePermission=\"my.app.permissions.write\"/> See also: CWE-??? (???) Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Auditing tips ● For stand-alone applications, check that declared and used permissions match in the manifest file. ○ For sets of apps, check that declared and used permissions match across the whole set of apps. Typos in custom permissions The problem: When used custom permissions don’t match declared custom permissions, Android defaults to silently failing to enforce the permission. Remediation ● If you are using custom permissions you can set up a presubmit check to see whether any declared permissions are not used or any used permissions are undeclared. ○ Doesn’t quite work if you have multiple interacting apps where not all apps declare and use the same permissions. Maybe a whitelist in the presubmit check is possible. Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Example code protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) { if (intent != null) { Intent privateIntent = new Intent(this, parseIntentClass(intent)); startActivity(privateIntent); } } See also: CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) Intent redirection The problem: Apps that accept and launch arbitrary intents from external sources may allow malware to start internal components indirectly or access protected content:// URIs. Auditing tips ● Find calls to startActivity and verify that Intent components are constructed from trusted data. ● Find calls Intent::getExtras where returned values are cast to Intent and verify that they are properly checked before being used. ○ It isn’t enough to check the target class name. Malware can reuse your class names and force your app to send an Intent', 'average accuracy rate is 91%.The main contributions are as follows: (1) For the four vulnerabilities that are caused by the mis- use of APIs, we divide them into three categories based on their behaviors. we perform the comprehensive study on them and form an analysis methodology for each vulnerability， which can help researchers to discover other vulnerabilities in the three categories.

(3) In order to verify our methodologies in large-scale Apps, we propose a static and scalable vulnerabilities de- tection tool based on our ﬁndings for vulnerability analy- sis，VulArcher. We download 6,177 Android Apps contain- ing transactions from the Internet, which are the latest version in 2018. After our random manual veriﬁcation of the results of VulArcher, it shows that the average accuracy rate is 91%. In addition, VulArcher can also detect the vulnerabilities on packed Apps. By adding rules in a conﬁguration ﬁle, Vu- lArcher can detect other categories of vulnerabilities. We will share VulArcher at https://buptnsrclab.github.io/blog/2020/ 01/03/vularcher- site- launched. II. BACKGROUD A. ANDROID APP OVERVIEW An Android App ﬁle is a compressed ﬁle that contains AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle, certiﬁcate ﬁles, dex ﬁle, static re- source ﬁles and so on. 1) Androidmanifest.xml, which deﬁned and included in every App, describes the name, version, permissions, component name and other information of the App. 2) Certiﬁcate ﬁles hold the signature information that ensures the integrity of the App. 3) Dex ﬁle is an executable ﬁle, which contains all the operating instructions and runtime data of an the App. Its structure is as follows: (1) Header: containing metadata, and a body which contains the majority of the data. . (2) String_ids: recording the offsets of each string in the data area. (3) Type_ids: recording the string indexs for each type. (4) Proto_ids: recording the declaration strings of methods, return type strings, parameter lists. (5) Field_ids: recording the classes, type, and method name which belongs to. (6) Method_ids: recording the classes’ name, declara- tion and the name of the methods and other informa- tion. (7) Class_defs: containing the type, inheritance hierar- chy, access metadata, and other class metadata . (8) Data: containing data of each classes. 4) Static resource ﬁles that exist in the res folder mainly contain pictures, audios and layout ﬁles of the App. B.

If these areconﬁrm whether the hard-coded in the App, the vulnerability exists bySDK method vulnerabilityexists. hard-codingthem. based on the four speciﬁc vulnerabilities. The details are described as follows. Improper certiﬁcate validation (ICV). An App uses the method of checkServerTrusted. No certiﬁcate veriﬁcation operation is performed in it, or in this method, only the expiration time of the certiﬁcate is veriﬁed, and no other information is veriﬁed. WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulnerability (WBCVV). An App uses the WebView API for certiﬁcate veriﬁcation, but the method onReceivedSslError(WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error) which is for handling the exception certiﬁcate does not perform any pro- cessing. This causes the abnormal certiﬁcate to pass the veriﬁcation. Vulnerability in overridden method (OM). The functions that lead to the above two vulnerabilities have common char- acteristics in analytical methods. These are subclass methods provided by the Android system to developers to customize the strong validation logic, and the parent class methods they inherit have the vulnerable logic in default. Developers don’t strictly follow the security speciﬁcations to customize VOLUME 4, 20167As shown in Fig 10, the working process of VulArcher can be divided into the following steps: Decompilation. For an App, VulArcher decompresses it to obtain the classes.dex ﬁle which contains the source code, the AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle which contains component in- formation, permissions and the resource ﬁles. VulArcher reverses the classes.dex based on Androgurd [28]. Through this process, It obtains the classes and methods in the source code of the App. Also it decompiles the AndroidManifest.xml ﬁle to obtain registered component information and conﬁgu- ration information. Packer Identition. VulArcher recognizes whether an App is packed according to formula (1) and (2). AC indicates the number of all components registered by the App, and CC indicates the number of classes in classes.dex which can obtain from the AC. Because the packed App almost hides all components and other logic codes, classes.dex does not con- tain these information. Some packing methods have signaturethe security policy code. The analysis method for this type of vulnerability is described in TABLE 6. An App has a overridden method that is to do the security validation, and its inherited parent method is a weak logic in default. If the method of the App is not written with strong veriﬁcation, then the App is vulnerable. WebView remote code execution vulnerability (WRCEV). There are three elements that can cause an App to have this vulnerability. First, the App needs to support to run on An- droid version 4.4 or below. Second, the App uses WebView’s API addJavascriptInterface(Object Object, String name) to allow JavaScript to run Java. Finally, the App does not add an API as shown in TABLE 5 to remove the weekness interface in the context of using the above API. Vulnerability of using unsafe APIs (USS). For an App, it uses a potentially vulnerable API, and the developer does not perform codes to protect against the vulnerability', 'kinds of vulnerabilities on a data set with more than 6000 Android Apps. The aforementioned vulnerabilities are ACOCDV, WRCEV, WBCVV and ICV. We found that webview and HTTPs are existed in most of ﬁnance and shopping apps. According to this, attackers can easily perform MITM. As for WRCEV which has been disclosed for a long time, it still exist in browser Apps, because developers lack the methods of vulnerability identiﬁcation and security development awareness. Apps that use Alibaba Cloud OSS services, information leakage vulnerability of Alibaba cloud OSS credentials is caused by the weak secure awareness of developers. We developed a vulnerability detection tool, VulArcher. The experiments show that it can automatically detect the above vulnerabilities, and has good scalability. One of vulnerabilities which VulArcher detected had been included in China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) ID(CNVD- 2017-23282). It detected more than 6000 Apps and found nearly 3000 Apps with the above vulnerabilities. and we have manually veriﬁed the accuracy of results among nearly 300 Apps. The source codes of VulArcher and sam- ple data presented in this paper can be utilized by further researchers. We incentivize this by making our data publicly available [46]. APPENDIXVIII. CONCLUSIONS ACKNOW LEDGEMENT', 'that our tool is feasible and effective. For the convenience of researchers in related communities, We make our data and tool available at https://buptnsrclab.github.io/blog/2020/01/03/vularcher-site-launched. et al. [13] analyzed a large-scale of mobile web Apps, and found that vulnerabilities are presented in all corners of the Android ecosystem. They did not propose methods for vulnerability veriﬁcation. Li et al. [14] analysed a small set of Android music Apps and focused on the issue of data leakage during client and server communication. Li et al. [15] [16] proposed a solution to quickly identify Android source code vulnerability ignoring to analyse Apps’ vulnerabilities. Mu et al. [17] contributed to how to quickly reproduce the vulnerabilities by combining the vulnerability reports with widely crowdsourced information. In 2019, Diao et al. [8] analyzed one vulnerability caused by the usage of theI. INTRODUCTION2accessibility API. Amin et al. [9] focused on proposing a detection tool for Android vulnerabilities, they did not give out a methodology for analyzing Android vulnerabilities. Luo et al. [18] was concerned about the vulnerabilities of the Android Framework and adopt a symbolic execution method to detect vulnerabilities. Wu et al. [19] conducted a systematic study for Android system vulnerabilities. Aforementioned vulnerabilities researches are related to the web vulnerabilities [20]. Although these vulnerabilities have been reported for a long time, they have received little attention. Moreover, researchers did not consider how to ana- lyze the vulnerabilities of these Apps if it is packed [21]–[23]. To the best of our knowledge, there is little effective analysis on aforementioned vulnerabilities. There is a very serious problem that many vulnerabilities reported early still exist in latest Apps, even in the same App. The main reason is that there is no feasible and complete vulnerability veriﬁcation workﬂows for developers. In additional， more and more web functions are used in Apps [24], these functions may also increase new vulnerabilities of Apps. Users send their infor- mation through the network in the process of Apps，which makes it is particular important for Apps to ensure(assure) their security. In this paper, our target of vulnerabilities are related to web functions. By manual analysis of 400 Apps, we ﬁnd the vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of APIs accounted for the majority, and the most of vulnerabilities caused by API misuse are WRCEV, WBCVV, ICV and ACOCDV. So we chose these four vulnerabilities as our study goals. At the same time, we divide the above four vulnerabilities into three categories based on their behaviors: Overridden method(Cat1:OM), Use unsafe settings(Cat2:USS) and Data leakage of sensitive information(Cat3:DLSI). Contributions. Based on the above analysis, we explore the severity of these vulnerabilities and perform the comprehen- sive study on the four vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of APIs and form an analysis methodology for each category of vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate them, we propose corresponding improvement recommendations. Based on the methodology, we propose a vulnerability veriﬁcation work- ﬂow for each vulnerability. In order to verify the effectiveness of our analysis methodology in large-scale Apps on the Internet. Based on our ﬁndings, we propose a vulnerability detection tool, named VulArcher. It can detect the above four vulnerabilities in packed or unpacked Android Apps,and the', 'music Apps that are analyzed mainly produce man-in-the-middle hijacking attacks when communicating with servers. Qian et al. [23] proposed a structure called app property graph (APG) for Android vulnerabilities. Based on this feature representation method, a detection tool is proposed for ﬁve common vulnerabilities. But they did not give workﬂows for the veriﬁcation of the vulnerabilities. Chen et al. [41] manually analysed several OAuth providers for Apps and determined how differences between the Apps and browser environments lead to the OAuth vulnerability. Wu et al. [1] proposed a detection method for the confused deputy vul- nerability in Android applications based on features of An- droidManifest.xml ﬁle and Control Flow Graph (CFG). Fang et al. [5] studyed an input validation vulnerability in Android inter-component communication. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the incomplete security veriﬁcation mechanism of Apps developers. Yang et al. [10] used a combination of static and dynamic methods to analyze the App’s dynamic loading vulnerability. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the insecure veriﬁcation on the loaded executable ﬁle. Yang et al. [20] studyed about security issues caused by mixed postMessage Origin Stripping Vulnerability(OSV) in Apps. Ranganath et al. [42] proposed a detection tool for supporting large-scale Android vulnerabilities, they didn’t conduct analysis method for vulnerabilities. Farhang et al. [43] focused on how different when vendors deal with An- droid vulnerabilities.The vulnerability results detected by VulArcher contain both third-party components and the App itself. At present, we regard these two aspects as all the vulnerabilities of the App. If we want to distinguish the vulnerability results. We can organize a third-party component library, which contains information such as the package name of the component. The vulnerability results detected by VulArcher contains the package name and class name of a vulnerability, so we use the package name and the class name to go back to the component library to check whether the vulnerability belongs to the App itself or third-party components. C. VULARCHER PERFORMANCE VI. DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONSVII. RELATED W ORK12This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No.2018YFB0804703.Other studies explored different vulnerabilities from we studied. Feng et al. [44] analyzed some vulnerabilities related to Binderin Android, and proposed an automated tool for detecting this type of vulnerabilities from the analysis of the causes of the vulnerabilities. Mario et al. [45] analyzed Android system vulnerabilities by using the Bulletin re- source. Zhang et al. [21] mainly studyed the Android system- level vulnerabilities. Through analysis rules and results, they proposed a detection tool for this type of vulnerabilities. Table 13 gives the the attack results of “Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability ”. Table 14 gives the attack results of “WebView remote code execution vulnerability”. Since there are no more than 100 Apps for the above two types of vulnerabilities, we have all analyzed. Table 11 gives a detailed description of 98 Apps randomly selected which were detected “WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulner- ability”. As Table 12 shown, we selected 99 Apps that were taged as “Improper certiﬁcate validation”, and we recorded whether or not it can be attacked for each App.We deeply analyzed the four', 'a scripting language or interpreter in an app can lead to exposure of app internals if the security boundaries of the interpreter are not well understood. Remediation ● Disable user-supplied input if possible. ● Build your own limited-scope interpreter or interface to more permissive interpreters. ● Otherwise sanitize scripts, disable scripting, or restrict permissions and abilities of interpreter engine.

In this circumstance, developers focus on how to quickly implement the logical functions of Apps and make it more user-friendly. Nevertheless, they spend little time on security issues of Apps.Static analysis, Vulnerability, Mobile agents, Security, Application software, DetectionABSTRACT Nowadays, people’s lifestyle is more and more dependent on mobile applications (Apps), such as shopping, ﬁnancial management and surﬁng the internet. However, developers mainly focus on the implementation of Apps and the improvement of user experience while ignoring security issues. In this paper, we perform the comprehensive study on vulnerabilities caused by misuse of APIs and form a methodology for this type of vulnerability analysis. We investigate the security of three types of Android Apps including ﬁnance, shopping and browser which are closely related to human life. And we analyze four vulnerabilities including Improper certiﬁcate validation(CWE-295:ICV), WebView bypass certiﬁcate vali- dation vulnerability(CVE-2014-5531:WBCVV), WebView remote code execution vulnerability(CVE-2014- 1939:WRCEV) and Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability(CNVD-2017-09774:ACOCDV). In order to verify the effectiveness of our analysis method in large-scale Apps on the Internet, we propose a novel scalable tool - VulArcher, which is based on heuristic method and used to discover if the above vulnerabilities exist in Apps. We download a total of 6114 of the above three types of samples in App stores, and we use VulArcher to perform the above vulnerability detection for each App. We perform manual veriﬁcation by randomly selecting 100 samples of each vulnerability. We ﬁnd that the accuracy rate for ACOCDV can reach 100%, the accuracy rate for WBCVV can reach 95%, and the accuracy rate for the other two vulnerabilities can reach 87%. And one of vulnerabilities detected by VulArcher has been included in China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) ID(CNVD-2017-23282). Experiments show', 'in the call- ing link and the context of it. Because some vulnerabilities are related to the Android environment, API level required for Apps is also one of the elements to identify the vulnerability. We can combine the above elements to determine whether the vulnerability exists. Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability (ACOCDV). For an App that uses the API OSSPlainTextAK- SKCredentialProvider provided by the Alibaba OSS SDK to create credential information with server, its secretKey needed in the method is hard coded in the program. This causes the existence of information disclosure vulnerability. Data leakage of sensitive information (DLSI). The analy- sis and characteristics of this category vulnerabiliy is shown in TABLE 6. An App has an invoke method that uses sen- sitive information. The object of the sensitive information is traced to determine whether it is hard-coded in the App. If it is hard- coded in it then the vulnerability exists. The algorithm of building TCFG.p (4) (5) (6)ﬁles, ie. libexe*.so and libexecma**.so. In order to further clarify packing methods, VulArcher uses the ﬁngerprint to identify the detailed packing type and version of the App. F= (1) { ≥App (2) Unpacking. At present, more and more Apps are packed. Static analysis can not directly get the real code of the packed Apps. This causes static detection to fail to analyze vulnera- bilities of such Apps. Therefore, the analysis of packed Apps should be carried out by unpacking method, for extracting the original code of Apps. The unpacking method used in this system DexX [27] is a result of our previous research. It can handle the six packers, such as Ali [29], Baidu [30], Bangcle [31], Tencent [32], Qihoo 360 Mobile [33], and ijiami [34]. This paper does not elaborate too much for the method. Building Taint Path. VulArcher creates a taint control ﬂow graph(TCFG) of a classes.dex, the algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. VulArcher creates a control ﬂow graph(CFG) of the classes.dex. the set V of p nodes in CFG is shown in formula (3). Each vk contains the package name(pk), class name(ck) and method(mk). As shown in formula (4), the set IA of m interested APIs is a subset of V . For each iAj, we follow the heuristic method to ﬁnd its taint path tpj, it’s shown in formula (5). V ′ is a subset of V , the points in V′ are related to the control ﬂow of iAj. If vk has a control ﬂow to vw, we think there is a taint control ﬂow relationship from vk to vw <vk, vw>, we denote the set of all the above relationships as E′. As shown in formula (6), TCFG is composed of all tpj(j = 1, ....., m). V={vk=(pkgk,ck,mk)|k=1,...,p} (3) Algorithm 1IV. VULARCHER-A TOOL TO DETECT VULNERABILITIES A.

It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on Apps. In the use of such a network transmission protocol, the App veriﬁes whether the certiﬁcate on the server side is a compliant certiﬁcate, so that both sides of the communication can be trusted. Apps use the X509TrustManager class to trust certiﬁcates. The weakness that the App improper certiﬁcate validation is described in CWE-295, when a certiﬁcate is invalid, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the- middle (MITM) attack. The weakness code is shown in Fig 1. We extract 100 Apps in the dataset, After manual analyzing, we ﬁnd that 81 of these Apps with the weakness, as shown in Table 4. Hence we analysis this weakness in the paper.Certiﬁcate veriﬁcation APIs are used for HTTPs commu- nication process of Apps, through which developers can cus- tomize the verﬁﬁcation rules. TABLE 2 summarizes related APIs. SDK is a set of tools provided by an organization, and are used to develop Android applications. For example, SDK pro- vided by Alibaba help developers use the company’s services. TABLE 3 shows APIs in Alibaba OSS Cloud service SDK. The WebView component supports certiﬁcate veriﬁcation when loading webpages with HTTPs protocol. As described in CVE-2014-5531, when an App is displaying data through WebView, at the same time, the function of verifying the validity of the certiﬁcate in this component does not work. In this case, the App will be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, And attacks can obtain sensitive information via a crafted certiﬁcate. As shown in Fig 2, the WebView is used to load the webpage, when the certiﬁcate veriﬁcation fails, it still allows the data exchange between the App and the server side of the crafted certiﬁcate. Table 4 shows that we ﬁnd 86 Apps in 100 have this vulnerability, so it is worthwhile to analyze the vulnerability in detail. 3) WebView remote code execution vulnerability According to Google [25], there are 2 billion active devices on Android monthly, and close to 10% are running in An- droid 4.3 or lower versions and more than 4% are running in Android 4.1 or lower versions. That indicates that JS-to-Java interface vulnerabilities may still affect hundreds of millions of users. Table 1 describes some of the APIs for the Web-', 'the following environ- ment: The CPU is e5-2640v4, the memory is 32G, system is Linux 64 and python 2.7. In this paper, the main types of Apps we focus on are ﬁnancial, shopping, and browser. We downloaded a total of 6177 Apps from the Baidu [36], Wandoujia [37], Qihoo [38] and Huawei [39] App Stores, which were released from January to August 2018. Of these, 3,160 Apps are in the ﬁnancial category, 2,954 Apps are in the shopping category, and the remaining 63 Apps are in the browser category. Table 7 shows the distribution of three types of Apps from January to August 2018. It includes classiﬁcation by sample category of Apps, classiﬁcation by time. Table 8 shows the distribution of three types of Apps’ size.on Burpsuite, which is mainly responsible for analyzing the trafﬁc information of mobile, extracting the Host and body and sending it to the server. The web service module is mainly responsible for auto installing Apps and recycling the results of analyzing network trafﬁc, also, determining whether the App is attacked by MIMT automately. A veriﬁcation method for WRCEV. As shown in Fig 12, our veriﬁcation method is mainly to inject malicious JavaScript code in to the App’s network trafﬁc by MIMT. We use Burpsuite to block all trafﬁc sent by the mobile and in- jecting the written malicious JavaScript code in the response. If the JavaScript can successfully execute malicious code, the code will send a record to the web service to record whether the App exists the vulnerability. A veriﬁcation method for ACOCDV. We use the Jeb to reverse the App, and we look for the code module initialized by OSSClient in the reverse smali code. We ﬁnd out whether initialize method by using plaintext accessKey and secretKey. We get these keys, and use the OSSUtils to connect the service.1: Input: interestSet, FR, TR {interestSet in the algorithm represents all sensitive APIs and methods that may cause vulnerabilities in the App. FR represents a collection of rules for vulnerability ﬁxes and TR represents the set of rules that the vulnerability triggers.} 2: Output:output(path,contextSlice){Thisstoresthedetailedcodesnippet of the vulnerability and the path where the vulnerability is located.} 3: INITIALIZE output(path,contextSlice)=∅ {FindPath can ﬁnd the caller paths in the APK through a function that is suspected of a vulnerability.} 4: for each ti 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: ∈ InterestSet do path⇐ FindPath(TCFG,ti) contextSlice formation by the path.} if(FR= if ⇐ GetContextSlice(path) {Geting detailed function in- 6 ∅)and(TR=6 ∅)then HeuSearch(contextSlice,TR) == True and HeuSearch(contextSlice,FR) == False then output(path,contextSlice) endif endif ifFR=6 ∅then ifHeuSearch(contextSlice,FR)==Truethen continue else output(path,contextSlice) endif endif ifTR=6 ∅then ifHeuSearch(contextSlice,TR)==Truethen output(path,contextSlice) else continue endif endif 26: end for 27: return output(path,contextSlice)358 291 8 657213 224 4 441391 376 3 770526 557 4 1087435 467 19 921455 475 9 939504 706 14 122472 64 2 138 ≥ 116 108 0 224S F B TJan Feb Mar Apr May JunJulAug 0-5 5-10 10-15 15-20 20-25 25-30 30-35 35-40 40-45 45-50 S418 F511 B677 736 510 685 492 408 10 910 235 275 194 177 2 373 130 101 92', 'Android app vulnerability classes A whirlwind overview of common security and privacy problems in Android apps Introduction How Google Play Protect educates developers to make millions of apps safer to use ● Overview of common Android app vulnerabilities reported through the Google Play Security Rewards Program ● Explicitly not an attempt at creating a complete audit guide ○ Focused only to vulnerabilities in scope for our bug bounty ● For each vulnerability present ○ Overview ○ Auditing tips ○ Remediation tips ○ CWE ID (Common Weakness Enumeration) and other resources Content of the presentation ● You are an app developer: ○ Understand which severe vulnerabilities are common even in top apps by top developers ○ Learn how to find more information about how to identify and fix these vulnerabilities ● You are a security researcher: ○ Understand what common vulnerabilities are worth looking into ○ Learn how to find these vulnerabilities to earn your own bug bounties How to use this presentation Android app vulnerabilities 19 vulnerability classes across 5 themes Insecure connections Use of insecure network protocols The problem: Loading data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to replace, remove, and inject code. Example code URL url = new URL(\"http://www.google.com\"); HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream(); See also: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) Use of insecure network protocols The problem: Loading data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to replace, remove, and inject code. Auditing tips ● Review the app’s network security configuration (an Android P feature) to understand whether app is allowed to use insecure network protocols in the first place. ○ https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config (“Network security configuration”) ● Grep the app’s code for “http:”, “ftp”, “smtp:”, and URLs that indicate use of insecure network protocols. ● Understand common entry points into the network such as the URL class or the WebView class and check whether there are code flows that lead to insecure connections being made. Use of insecure network protocols The problem: Loading data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to replace, remove, and inject code. Remediation ● Apps targeting Android P and above are safe by default. If such apps still want to make insecure connections, they have to define a network security configuration that allows that. ● Use javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection as much as possible. ● Presubmit checks to look for URLs for insecure protocols are easy to set up. ● The Android Lint check InsecureBaseConfiguration flags insecure HTTP connections. Data transmission over insecure protocols The problem: Sending sensitive data over insecure networks such as HTTP allows attackers that control the network (for example a local WiFi network) to intercept, modify, and steal the data.

In this way, the entire vulnerability search process is fast and accurate. An App contains many classes and methods, if we iterate through each method to search vulnerabilities and weak- nesses, it will certainly affect the efﬁciency of detection. So we ﬁrst built the TCFG of the App, recording classes and methods that contain suspicious interesting paths. When we are looking for vulnerabilities, we can use the heuristic-based approach described in Algorithm 2 to ﬁnd out if a vulnera- bility exists. The interestSet in the algorithm represents allDetection. VulArcher uses the rules of above vulnerabil- ities and the TCFG of an App generated in the Building Taint Path for vulnerability judgment. In order to detect vulnerabilities faster, we propose a heuristic vulnerability search algorithm as described in Algorithm 2, so that we can avoid matching vulnerability rules of all App code. For tpj, VulArcher extracts its context slices(csj). R is a set of vulnerability rules. The input to function f(.) is R and CS. If the m matchs the vr, the App is commented with the vulnerability which vr represents. CS={csj|j=1,...,r} (7) Nowadays there are more and more vulnerability detection tools. To some certain extent, they can detect some vulnera- bilities and weaknesses. But they do not provide developers with some way to reproduce vulnerabilities. This is the reason why more and more vulnerabilities are ignored by de- velopers, as a result, many Apps still have vulnerabilities that have been reported for a long time. In this paper, we provide semi-automated veriﬁcation methods and workﬂow for the vulnerabilities and weaknesses we analyzed. This work can verify the detection results of VulArcher and provides readers with clear methods of vulnerabilities’ veriﬁcations. A veriﬁcation method for man-in-middle attack vul- nerability caused by weak certiﬁcate veriﬁcation. Fig 11 depicts the attack architecture for this weakness. First, we set up the environment to enable Burpsuite [35] to block all network trafﬁc from mobile. We write a script basedsensitive APIs and methods that may cause vulnerabilities in the App. FR represents a collection of rules for vulnerability ﬁxes and TR represents the set of rules that trigger the vul- nerability. The algorithm ﬁrst obtains a suspected vulnerable point in interestSet, then in the already constructed TCFG, it constructs the relevant slice content of all objects and variables in the point, that is, contextSlice. It uses a heuristic search algorithm to search in contextSlice. If there is a rule for repairing the vulnerability in the slice, then the App does not have the vulnerability. Otherwise, if it ﬁnds the rule for triggering the vulnerability in slice through the search algorithm, then it records the complete path information and slice of the vulnerability of the App. R Vul, notV ul,{vr1, vr2, . . . , vrn if vr is matched in CS other w ise= } B.

ANALYZE THE RESULTS TABLE 10 shows the details of the test results of all the Apps. We divide the samples vulnerability type into two categories according to whether or not is packed. It can be seen that even if the App is packed, vulnerabilities cannot be ﬁxed. Through the results, WBCVV and ICV have a high ratio, because most of the Apps’ network communication protocols now use HTTPs, developers use APIs to develop these functions, and ignore the security of certiﬁcate veriﬁcation for the convenience of the development process. WRCEV is the least, there may be a direct relationship with the current Apps that rarely supports version of Android 4.4 and below. Finding 1: Although the WRCEV was ﬁrst reported in 2014, there is still a 4.7% Apps in the currently released browser Apps. Finding 2: When the JS-to-Java reﬂection function in WebView is used in Apps, it is able to strictly limit the Android version to be greater than 17, and use the interface function shown in TABLE 5. Manually Verﬁfy. We randomly select samples with and without vulnerabilities in the detection results. We manually analyze those samples. For those which need a user account to use, and these accounts are not free to register externally, these are not the scope we consider. The analysis results are shown in TABLE 9, it is showed that VulArcher detects ACOCDV with high accuracy. Finding 3: When we do the MITM, we ﬁnd that many Apps not only do not carry out certiﬁcate veriﬁcation, but also transmit sensitive data such as user name and password in plaintext. It is very easy to cause the leakage of sensitive information. So it is necessary to encrypt sensitive informa- tion. Finding 4: The detection accuracy for ACOCDV can reach 100%, and for WBCVV can reach 95%. Also the accuracy is lightly lower and can reach 87% for the other two vulnera- bilities. VulArcher can help developers detect vulnerabilities before Apps are released. It can avoid releasing Apps with the above vulnerabilities. The irrelevance of vulnerabilities and sizes of Apps. Fig 13 shows the number of vulnerabilities in Apps with different sizes. It can be seen that the same category of vulnerabilities have almost the same probability distribution in different sized apps.', 'Both WBCVV and ICV have a high percentage in Apps of different sizes. Finding 5: The number and the type of vulnerabilities in Apps are independent of the size of them.Fig 14 shows the probability of vulnerabilities for each of the categories of Apps. ACOCDV does not exist in the browser Apps, because they do not need to use this service to store a large number of images. The reason that the percentage of WRCEV in these Apps is slightly higher than the other two types of Apps is most of these Apps use the WebView component and many of them support for the Android 4.4 version. Finding 6: More and more Apps face the vulnerability of MITM, because developers do not validate certiﬁcate for convenience. So certiﬁcate validation must be done strictly in the development. Finding 7: Although Alibaba OSS SDK has released new instructions to circumvent this credential information leak [40], results in Fig 14 shows that many Apps still have this vulnerability. This means that Apps should be timely updated the SDKversion to ﬁx the vulnerability. The trend of the vulnerability. Fig 15 shows the trend of probability of vulnerabilities for Apps in each month fromThe relationship between vulnerabilities and cate- gories.11TABLE 10 – Summary table of all sample detection results.(’P’ refers to ’Probability of vulnerability(%)’; ’ICV’ refers to ’Improper certiﬁcate validation, ’WBCVV’ refers to ’WebView bypass certiﬁcate validation vulnerability’, ’WRCEV’ refers to ’WebView remote code execution vulnerability’ and ’ACOCDV’ refers to ’Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability’) Packed Vulnerability VulnerabilityApps Summary 79 28 4285 3936P 1.278 0.453 69.370 63.720Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No70 9 19 9 2851 1434 2594 1342ACOCDV WRCEV WBCVV ICV We download the Apps to analyze the four types of vulnera- bilities, but the Apps was two years ago.

However, the latest Apps compared with the previous ones, the Android system versions they support has not been updated much, the APIs used in them has not been updated. Our ﬁndings are not biased.Efﬁciency. VulArcher takes an average of one minute to analyze an App. However, if the analysis App is packed, then the time to unpack it is an average of 50 seconds. Computing cost. For an App, the memory consumption is 400M, CPU utilization is 40%. Scalability. VulArcher supports the rules of vulnerabilities to detect them. Hence, for a new vulnerability, VulArcher only need to konw the vulnerability rule to complete the detection of the new vulnerability.January to August in 2018. It can be intuitively reﬂected that there are vulnerabilities and weekneses in the monthly release of Apps, and the number of vulnerabilities does not decline over time. Finding 8: As shown in Fig 15, the trend of vulnerabilities tends to be in a stable state. This shows that various vulnera- bilities still exist in Apps and developers do not mitigate these vulnerabilities.The study of Android vulnerabilities can be divided into two aspects, one is about the Apps and the other is about the Android OS. Li et al. [14] just conducted a detail analysis of the vul- nerabilities that will occur in the music Apps. The', 'View component. The addJavascriptInterface(Object object, String name) function provides a way to bridge between JavaScript and Java. It is equivalent to inject a Java object into the environment of JavaScript. So the JavaScript code running in the WebView can call all the public methods of the Java object by the object name. However, in this scenario, proper security measures are not used, which can lead to WRCEV as described in CVE-2014-1939, an attacker canIII. CASE STUDY A.

Table 4 shows that the vulnerability exists in current App Stores, and we should analyze why this vulnerability still occupies a high proportion. ACOCDV is a new vulnerability with wide inﬂuence in 2017. Alibaba cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a massive, safe and highly reliable cloud storage service provided by Al- ibaba. As shown in Fig 4, when developers use Alibaba cloud OSS service framework by the SDK, sensitive information, such as AccessKey and AccessKeySecret, is directly written into the code (for data protection, we perform sensitive information erasure processing). An attacker can easily get sensitive information through reversing the App, it causes data leakage from developers on cloud services. The data in Table 4 shows that the vulnerability the existence rate of the vulnerability is 20%, so the vulnerability of data leakage should be taken seriously.java/android/webkit/BrowserFrame.java in Android 4.4 and earlier uses the addJavascriptInterface in conjunction with creating an object of SearchBoxImpl class, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary Java code by leveraging access to the SearchBoxJavaBridge_ interface at certain Android version. An App in the above environment, when the WebView component uses the addJavascriptInterface(Object object, String name) API to establish the connection between JavaScript and Java without security restrictions. JavaScript in the webpage not only has permission to call Java object‘s methods in its runtime environment, but to execute Android system commands. The above description of the vulnerability is', 'summarized that when the App runtime environment belongs to Android version 4.4 or below, if the WebView addJavascriptInter- face(Object object, String name) API is used in the App and the developer has not added security restrictions, an attacker can build malicious JavaScript code perform instruction exe- cution on the App. VulnerabilityPOC (1) File MD5: cdc18db0cad812225d8412be4e27182b (2) version: 4.2 (3) Exploit: The App supports running under Android version 4.4. Fig 5 shows the code that causes the vulnerability in the App, it uses the WebView component to display a webpage. Also, it uses addJavascriptInterface(Object object, String name) API to make the JavaScript code can call the b object by string a method in the called HTML page. However, this App does not limit the vulnerability through some protection methods, so the App has the vulnerability.4) Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability (ACOCDV)B.

Viaing a MITM attack, we forged mali- cious JavaScript code into the webpage. Malicious JavaScript code executes the command \"ls - al /MNT/sdcard/\" to read ﬁle information in sdcard. As shown in Fig 6b, malicious JavaScript normally runs on the vulnerable App, which reads the ﬁle information from the sdcard directory of the Android device. It indicates that this vulnerability exists and can be exploited in the App. Insight. When developers use the addJavascriptInterface (Object object, String name) API to call a web page. As summarized in Table 5, the functions of removing the risk in- terface should be added to limit the permission of JavaScript code. They can eliminate the WRCEV in Apps. As shown in TABLE 6, the characteristics of vulnerabilities are summarized after a comprehensive case study of each vulnerability. In addition, after a lot of manual analysis of Apps of above vulnerabilities. We divided the four vulner- abilities into three categories, and generalized the analysis methods and characteristics of each type of vulnerabilityAlibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a secure and reliable cloud Storage Service provided by Alibaba. When the service is used in an Android App, the APIs provided by the SDK of the service need to be called in the App. However, developers usually simply copy the ofﬁcial sample code and don’t consider the security weekness of program- ming. Fig 7 is the demo code provided by the Alibaba cloud. Attackers can obtain', 'this set of credentials by using the OSS management tool to get the data in the service easily. It will result in information leakage and constitute a serious security weekness.

Because the App is packed, we use our unpacking tool [27] to get the source code of the App. As shown in Fig 8, it is the source code which is obtained after unpacking the App. Fig 9 is the code which contains sensitive information in the App. In onCreate method, we ﬁnd construct the object Alibaba cloud storage service initializes the object. When constructing an object, this method directly invoke the ac- cessKeyId and accessKeySecret, and both of these sensitive values are hard coded by the developer in the program, thus it causes the weakness of sensitive information.

            "CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) occurs when a cryptographic key is embedded directly into the source code of an application. This practice is highly insecure for several reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Easy Extraction:**  Attackers can easily extract hard-coded keys by simply decompiling or reverse-engineering the application's code.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Lack of Rotation:**  Hard-coding keys makes it impossible to rotate them without modifying and redistributing the entire application. Key rotation is crucial for maintaining long-term security, especially if a key is compromised.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Limited Key Management:**  Embedding keys directly into code hinders proper key management practices, such as storing keys securely, controlling access, and revoking compromised keys.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example:**\n",
            "\n",
            "```java\n",
            "private static String SECRET_KEY = \"MySecretAESKey99\"; \n",
            "\n",
            "// ... code using SECRET_KEY for encryption/decryption ... \n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "In this example, the `SECRET_KEY` is directly embedded in the code, making it vulnerable.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Impact:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Data Breaches:**  Attackers can decrypt sensitive data protected with the compromised key.\n",
            "* **System Compromise:** The hard-coded key could be used to impersonate the application or access restricted resources.\n",
            "* **Reputation Damage:** Exposure of hard-coded keys can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode user trust.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Remediation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Secure Key Storage:** Use secure key storage mechanisms like hardware security modules (HSMs), key management systems (KMS), or platform-specific secure storage APIs.\n",
            "* **Environment Variables:**  Store keys in environment variables, which are not part of the application code.\n",
            "* **Configuration Files:** Load keys from encrypted configuration files that are accessed securely.\n",
            "* **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** Derive keys from strong secrets stored securely, adding an extra layer of protection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Never hard-code cryptographic keys directly in your application's source code.\n",
            "* Prioritize secure key storage and management practices.\n",
            "* Implement key rotation strategies to mitigate the impact of compromised keys. \n",

            "**Description:**\n",
            "\n",
            "CWE-321 occurs when a cryptographic key is hard-coded directly into the source code of an application, making it easily accessible to an attacker. This weakness allows an attacker to extract the cryptographic key and use it to decrypt sensitive data, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Risk:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The risk associated with CWE-321 is high, as it allows an attacker to:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Decrypt sensitive data, such as financial information or personal identifiable information (PII).\n",
            "2. Use the extracted key to impersonate the application or system, allowing them to access unauthorized resources.\n",
            "3. Compromise the integrity of the data, leading to unauthorized modifications or tampering.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Examples:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are a few examples of how CWE-321 can manifest:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Hard-coding an encryption key in a mobile app:\n",
            "```java\n",
            "public class Encryptor {\n",
            "    private static final String ENCRYPTION_KEY = \"my_secret_key\";\n",
            "    // ...\n",
            "}\n",

            "<configuration>\n",
            "    <appSettings>\n",
            "        <add key=\"EncryptionKey\" value=\"my_secret_key\"/>\n",
            "    </appSettings>\n",
            "</configuration>\n",
            "```\n",
            "3. Using a hardcoded cryptographic key in a web application:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "def encrypt_data(data):\n",
            "    key = \"my_secret_key\"\n",

            "**Consequences:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The consequences of CWE-321 can be severe, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Data breaches: Sensitive data can be decrypted and accessed by unauthorized parties.\n",
            "2. System compromise: An attacker can use the extracted key to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.\n",
            "3. Loss of trust: The vulnerability can lead to a loss of trust in the application or organization, resulting in financial losses and reputational damage.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Remediation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "To remediate CWE-321, follow these best practices:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Use secure key storage:** Store cryptographic keys securely using a Key Management System (KMS), a Hardware Security Module (HSM), or a secure storage mechanism like a cryptographic vault.\n",
            "2. **Generate keys dynamically:** Generate cryptographic keys dynamically using a secure random number generator, and store them securely.\n",
            "3. **Use secure configuration:** Store configuration files securely, and avoid hard-coding cryptographic keys in configuration files.\n",
            "4. **Implement secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices, such as using secure encryption algorithms and libraries, and validating user input to prevent potential attacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these guidelines, you can effectively mitigate the risk associated with CWE-321 and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.\n"
